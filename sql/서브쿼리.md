## 서브쿼리

보다 sql문을 간결고 가독성있게.

## where절

```sql
SELECT u.user_id, u.name, u.email FROM users u
inner join orders o on u.user_id = o.user_id 
where o.payment_method = 'kakaopay'
```

```sql
SELECT * from users
WHERE user_id in (
	select user_id  from orders
	WHERE payment_method = 'kakaopay'	
)
```

### 심화

```sql
SELECT * from point_users pu
WHERE point > (
	select avg(pu.point) FROM point_users pu
	join users u on pu.user_id = u.user_id 
	WHERE u.name = '이**'
)
```

```sql
SELECT * from point_users pu
WHERE point > (
	select avg(pu.point) FROM point_users pu
	WHERE user_id in (
		SELECT user_id from users
		WHERE name = '이**'
	)
)
```

## select절

한 줄마다 실행

```sql
SELECT avg(likes) from checkins
WHERE user_id = '4b8a10e6'
```

```sql
SELECT c.checkin_id,
       c.user_id,
       c.likes,
       (
       	SELECT avg(likes) from checkins
		WHERE user_id = c.user_id
       ) as avg_likes_user
  from checkins c
```

## from절

join안의 테이블을 원래 있었던 테이블처럼 사용

```sql
SELECT pu.user_id, pu.point, a.avg_likes FROM point_users pu
inner join (
	SELECT user_id, round(AVG(likes),1) as avg_likes from checkins
	group by user_id
) a on pu.user_id = a.user_id
```

### 심화

```sql
select
	c.title,
	a.cnt_checkins,
	b.cnt_total,
	(a.cnt_checkins / b.cnt_total) as ratio
from (
	SELECT course_id, COUNT(DISTINCT(user_id)) as cnt_checkins from checkins c
	group by course_id
) a
inner join (
	select course_id, COUNT(*) as cnt_total  FROM orders o
	group by course_id
) b on a.course_id = b.course_id
inner join courses c on a.course_id = c.course_id 
```

## with절

	group by course_id
), table2 as (
	select course_id, COUNT(*) as cnt_total  FROM orders o
	group by course_id

select
	c.title,
	a.cnt_checkins,
	b.cnt_total,
	(a.cnt_checkins / b.cnt_total) as ratio
from table1 a
inner join table2 b on a.course_id = b.course_id
inner join courses c on a.course_id = c.course_id
